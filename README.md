# cDPL

It means to create DPL file for Potplayer.

## Requirements

- Python3.x

## Attention

Some videos(base on file type) can't read.

It may be that file type is not in `mediaExtendList`(you can find it at `plugin/cdpl/constants.py`).

- Push or issue on [Github](https://github.com/Zeroto521/Wox.Plugin.cDPL)
